This project is the Brailliac: Braille Keyboard app.
This app is an Android system keyboard (IME) based on a Braille grid.

It allows the user to input Unicode Braille cell characters using an intuitive input system. 

The keyboard also has an 'auto-translate' mode, which allows the user to type Braille symbols, but have the keyboard input the corresponding text in the primary (non-Braille) script of the user's language.
